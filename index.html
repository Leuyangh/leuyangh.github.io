                            <p>My name is Leu-yang Eric Huang and I'm a Computer Science(Games) major at the University of Southern California, currently in my Junior year.</p>
                            <p>My hobbies include art, music, and snowboarding. I mostly do Renaissance style charcoal sketches and oil painting but I've recently gotten into digital art as well. You can find more of my art here. My instruments are the flute I've played over a decade now and passed the Certificate of Merit Advanced with, and the guitar to a lesser extent.</p>
                            <p>As my major might allude to, my favorite hobby is gaming. I enjoy competitive multiplayer games with high skill ceilings and teamwork, such as Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Currently I play mostly League of Legends (peak rank Diamond 2) and sometimes Hearthstone. I also love a good RPG or strategy game, anything I can get truly invested in emotionally or intellectually.</p>
                            <p>My latest game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVqTsXYnIY" target="_blank">Joyeuse</a>, the adventure of a girl and her magical sword. You can find the zipped Windows executable <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12-MKEhSBgD1t4C-edPYB719iCVEp1E_W/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to download and play!</p>

                                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVqTsXYnIY" target="_blank">Joyeuse</a> is a game about a young girl's quest for justice. After the death of her brother, Sara hears a call in her mind that brings her deep into the forest. Finding the ancient sentient sword Joyeuse, the pair vow to hunt down the murderer and cut revenge from him. </p>
                                <p>Made in Unity, it features handpainted artwork, original music, and visual novel esque gameplay. The trailer for the game can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12-MKEhSBgD1t4C-edPYB719iCVEp1E_W/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, while the zipped Windows executable can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVqTsXYnIY" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                                <p>These are a collection of projects done with OpenGL practicing rendering images from inputs.</p>
                                <p>The first project is a heightmap renderer that takes in a black-and-white image and renders a manipulatable 3D model from it, using each pixel's brightness as its height. An example <a href="https://github.com/Leuyangh/CS420-Projects/blob/master/CS420_Assignment1/assign1/spiral.jpg" target="_blank">before</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Leuyangh/CS420-Projects/blob/master/CS420_Assignment1/assign1/Screenshot%20(2).png" target="_blank">after</a>. The GitHub repository for this project is <a href="https://github.com/Leuyangh/CS420-Projects/tree/master/CS420_Assignment1" target="_blank">here</a> and a brief video demonstration of manipulations is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf9dnhcD9ZE" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                                <p>The second project renders a roller coaster from points that form the data to create a Catmull-Rom spline. From the spline, it's normal, binormal, and tangent are calculated and a 3D track with crossbars is rendered and the camera is moved along the center of the track according to a speed adjustable by a right-click menu in order to simulate a roller coaster. A textured world bounding box is rendered as well. The GitHub repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Leuyangh/CS420-Projects/tree/master/CS420_Assignment2" target="_blank">here</a> and a brief video demonstration is <a href="https://youtu.be/7YW4qJYXcUs" target="_blank">here</a>, the original data points being <a href="https://github.com/Leuyangh/CS420-Projects/blob/master/CS420_Assignment2/assign2/assign2/splines/goodRide.sp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                                <p>The last project is a raytracer that takes scene data of spheres, triangles, and lights, and renders a ray-traced scene image from them. The GitHub repository for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Leuyangh/CS420-Projects/tree/master/CS420_Assignment3" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                                <h2 class="major">Space Miner</h2>
                                <p>Space miner is a site featuring the ability to log in and play two different games. Guest users can play a single player game in which they control a starship and try to collect as many gems as possible within the time limit. Logged in users can play the single player game as well as a multiplayer game where competing ships try to collect gems and grow larger, consuming any smaller ships they hit, with the ultimate goal of controlling the stars. Unfortunately, the site is no longer being hosted but the GitHub repository for the project is <a href="https://github.com/tonythetiger06/CSCI-201-Project/tree/master/CSCI201_FinalProject_V2" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                                <p>This was a large team project made using the waterfall development process. The single player game is made though PhaserJS which is a JavaScript framework for creating arcade style games. The multiplayer game uses NodeJS to connect and synchronize competing players.</p>
